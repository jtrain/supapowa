==================================
Powersim - Power System Simulation

Author: Jervis Whitley

Sustain a growing city's demand 
for electrical power by developing 
a reliable power grid and building
power stations. The price you set
for the electrical power you 
deliver will affect the growth 
of the city. Growing a large city
will require a delicate balance 
between the price signals you send
and power system reliability 
(ability to copy with unplanned
outages and maximum user demand).
