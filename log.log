PowerSim:

added new level module and levelevents. 
These enable people to script levels by having events occur after
a given amount of ticks[default] (or whichever method is chosen by user.) 

Implemented AddUnitEvent, MakeSwing event and MakePopup event.
MakePopup seems to have a bug in which it cannot be created at time 0.

Noticed some other bugs to do with surfaces not displaying during
transitions between menus. Requires testing on windows pc to see if
it occurs there.

Also notice that it is difficult to restart game without exiting and 
actually beginning game again.
